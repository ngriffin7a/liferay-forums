/**
 * Resolves user mentions embedded in a forum post body.
 *
 * <h3>How mentions are stored</h3>
 * <p>The message composer inserts a mention in the platform's OOTB shape: the
 * visible {@code @screenName} token, wrapped in a
 * {@code <span class="lfr-ac-content">} by CKEditor 4 or emitted as a bare text
 * token by CKEditor 5 (which drops unknown spans on serialization). The visible
 * token is the reliable channel across editor versions, so handles are parsed
 * with a boundary-anchored {@code @screenName} regex rather than from a class or
 * data attribute — mirroring the platform's own {@code DefaultMentionsMatcher}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The screen name (rather than the numeric user id) is the durable channel
 * because it is a filterable/indexed field: mentions resolve to email addresses
 * with a single site-scoped OData query, and — because that query is scoped to
 * the site — a handle for a non-member simply does not match and is dropped. A
 * crafted body therefore cannot notify or probe users outside the site.</p>

	/* Match the visible "@screenName" token, whether it sits in plain text or

	   must be preceded by start-of-input, whitespace, "]" or ">" (so "@" that
	   follows other text -- e.g. an email address -- is not treated as a
	   mention). "@" may also appear HTML-encoded as "&#64;".

	   The screen name is captured as dot/hyphen-separated word segments
	   (\w+(?:[.\-]\w+)*), which stops on its own at the first non-screen-name
	   character. This deliberately does NOT require a trailing boundary: unlike
	   the platform's DefaultMentionsMatcher -- whose mentions are always tag-
	   wrapped, so the next character is always "<" -- our CKEditor 5 mentions
	   are BARE text tokens that may be butted directly against punctuation
	   (e.g. "@ravi.patel: hello"). The segment structure also avoids swallowing
	   a trailing "." or "-" (e.g. a sentence-ending "@ravi.patel." yields
	   "ravi.patel", not "ravi.patel."). */
